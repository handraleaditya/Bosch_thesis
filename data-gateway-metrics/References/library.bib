   abstract = {<p>Due to sharp increases in data dimensions, working on every data mining or machine learning (ML) task requires more efficient techniques to get the desired results. Therefore, in recent years, researchers have proposed and developed many methods and techniques to reduce the high dimensions of data and to attain the required accuracy. To ameliorate the accuracy of learning features as well as to decrease the training time dimensionality reduction is used as a pre-processing step, which can eliminate irrelevant data, noise, and redundant features. Dimensionality reduction (DR) has been performed based on two main methods, which are feature selection (FS) and feature extraction (FE). FS is considered an important method because data is generated continuously at an ever-increasing rate; some serious dimensionality problems can be reduced with this method, such as decreasing redundancy effectively, eliminating irrelevant data, and ameliorating result comprehensibility. Moreover, FE transacts with the problem of finding the most distinctive, informative, and decreased set of features to ameliorate the efficiency of both the processing and storage of data. This paper offers a comprehensive approach to FS and FE in the scope of DR. Moreover, the details of each paper, such as used algorithms/approaches, datasets, classifiers, and achieved results are comprehensively analyzed and summarized. Besides, a systematic discussion of all of the reviewed methods to highlight authors' trends, determining the method(s) has been done, which significantly reduced computational time, and selecting the most accurate classifiers. As a result, the different types of both methods have been discussed and analyzed the findings. Â </p>},

The dimensions of data indicate the number of features that have been measured for each observation. It has become a challenging task to analyze high dimensional data.

Selection of an appropriate dimension reduction technique can help to enhance the processing speed and reduce the time and effort required to extract valuable information.

Tens of such techniques have been proposed, aiming to address a wide set of requirements, such as ability to show the high-dimensional data structure, distance or neighborhood preservation, computational scalability, stability to data noise and/or outliers, and practical ease of use. However, it is far from clear for practitioners how to choose the best technique for a given use context. We present a survey of a wide body of projection techniques that helps answering this question. For this, we characterize the input data space, projection techniques, and the quality of projections, by several quantitative metrics. We sample these three spaces according to these metrics, aiming at good coverage with bounded effort. We describe our measurements and outline observed dependencies of the measured variables. Based on these results, we draw several conclusions that help comparing projection techniques, explain their results for different types of data, and ultimately help practitioners when choosing a projection for a given context. Our methodology, datasets, projection implementations, metrics, visualizations, and results are publicly open, so interested stakeholders can examine and/or extend this benchmark.},

However, the resulting projections suffer from artifacts such as bad local neighborhood preservation and clusters tearing. Interactively coloring the projection according to the discrepancy between original proximities relative to a reference item reveals these artifacts, but it is not clear if conveying these proximities using color and displaying only local information really helps the visual analysis of projections. We conducted a controlled experiment to investigate the relevance of this interactive technique to help the visual analysis of any projection regardless its quality. We compared the bare projection to the interactive coloring of the original proximities on different visual analysis tasks involving outliers and clusters. Results indicate that the interactive coloring is worthwhile for local tasks as it is significantly robust to projection artifacts whereas the projection is not. However this interactive technique does not help significantly for visual clustering tasks for that projections already give a suitable overview.},

These tasks are supported by three classes of interactive view manipulations: focusing, linking, and arranging views. This discussion extends earlier work on the principles of focusing and linking and sets them on a firmer base. Next, we give a high-level introduction to a particular system for multivariate data visualization - XGobi. This introduction is not comprehensive but emphasizes XGobi tools that are examples of focusing, linking, and arranging views; namely, high-dimensional projections, linked scatterplot brushing, and matrices of conditional plots. Finally, in a series of case studies in data visualization, we show the powers and limitations of particular focusing, linking, and arranging tools. The discussion is dominated by high-dimensional projections that form an extremely well-developed part of XGobi. Of particular interest are the illustration of asymptotic normality of high-dimensional projections (a theorem of Diaconis and Freedman), the use of high-dimensional cubes for visualizing factorial experiments, and a method for interactively generating matrices of conditional plots with high-dimensional projections. Although there is a unifying theme to this article, each section - in particular the case studies - can be read separately.},

The SOM is shown to produce a quantized, qualitative scaling and while the ViSOM a quantitative or metric scaling and approximates principal curve/surface.

   abstract = {We study the problem of visualizing large-scale and high-dimensional data in a low-dimensional (typically 2D or 3D) space. Much success has been reported recently by techniques that first compute a similarity structure of the data points and then project them into a low-dimensional space with the structure preserved. These two steps suffer from considerable computational costs, preventing the state-of-the-art methods such as the t-SNE from scaling to large-scale and high-dimensional data (e.g., millions of data points and hundreds of dimensions). We propose the LargeVis, a technique that first constructs an accurately approximated K-nearest neighbor graph from the data and then layouts the graph in the low-dimensional space. Comparing to t-SNE, LargeVis significantly reduces the computational cost of the graph construction step and employs a principled probabilistic model for the visualization step, the objective of which can be effectively optimized through asynchronous stochastic gradient descent with a linear time complexity. The whole procedure thus easily scales to millions of high-dimensional data points. Experimental results on real-world data sets demonstrate that the LargeVis outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in both efficiency and effectiveness. The hyper-parameters of LargeVis are also much more stable over different data sets.},

A number of NLDR methods have been developed, but there is limited understanding of how these methods work and the relationships between them. There is limited basis for using existing NLDR theory for deriving new algorithms. We provide a novel framework for analysis of NLDR via a connection to the statistical theory of linear smoothers. This allows us to both understand existing methods and derive new ones. We use this connection to smoothing to show that asymptotically, existing NLDR methods correspond to discrete approximations of the solutions of sets of differential equations given a boundary condition. In particular, we can characterize many existing methods in terms of just three limiting differential operators and boundary conditions. Our theory also provides a way to assert that one method is preferable to another; indeed, we show Local Tangent Space Alignment is superior within a class of methods that assume a global coordinate chart defines an isometric embedding of the manifold.},

   abstract = {The security of networked systems has become a critical universal issue that influences individuals, enterprises and governments. The rate of attacks against networked systems has increased dramatically, and the tactics used by the attackers are continuing to evolve. Intrusion detection is one of the solutions against these attacks. A common and effective approach for designing Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) is Machine Learning. The performance of an IDS is significantly improved when the features are more discriminative and representative. This study uses two feature dimensionality reduction approaches: (i) Auto-Encoder (AE): an instance of deep learning, for dimensionality reduction, and (ii) Principle Component Analysis (PCA). The resulting low-dimensional features from both techniques are then used to build various classifiers such as Random Forest (RF), Bayesian Network, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA) for designing an IDS. The experimental findings with low-dimensional features in binary and multi-class classification show better performance in terms of Detection Rate (DR), F-Measure, False Alarm Rate (FAR), and Accuracy. This research effort is able to reduce the CICIDS2017 dataset&rsquo;s feature dimensions from 81 to 10, while maintaining a high accuracy of 99.6% in multi-class and binary classification. Furthermore, in this paper, we propose a Multi-Class Combined performance metric     C o m b i n e  d  M c       with respect to class distribution to compare various multi-class and binary classification systems through incorporating FAR, DR, Accuracy, and class distribution parameters.

   abstract = {Efficient modeling of high-dimensional data requires extracting only relevant dimensions through feature learning. Unsupervised feature learning has gained tremendous attention due to its unbiased approach, no need for prior knowledge or expensive manual processing, and ability to handle exponential data growth. Deep Autoencoder (AE) is a state-of-the-art deep neural network for unsupervised feature learning, which learns embedded-representations using a series of stacked layers. However, as the AE network gets deeper, these learned embedded-representations can deteriorate due to vanishing gradient, leading to performance degradation. This article presents ResNet Autoencoder (RAE) and its convolutional version (C-RAE) for unsupervised feature learning. The advantage of RAE and C-RAE is that it enables the user to add residual connections for increased network capacity without incurring the cost of degradation for unsupervised feature learning compared to standard AEs. While RAE and C-RAE inherit all the advantages of AEs, such as automated non-linear feature extraction and unsupervised learning, they also allow users to design larger networks without adverse effects on feature learning performance. We performed classification on learned embedded-representation to evaluate RAE and C-RAE. RAE and C-RAE were compared against AEs on MNIST, Fashion MNIST, and CIFAR10 datasets. When increasing the number of layers, C-RAE outperformed AE by showing significantly lower performance degradation of classification accuracy (less than 3%) compared to AE (33% to 65%). Further, C-RAE exhibited higher mean accuracy and lower variance of accuracy than standard AE. When comparing RAE and C-RAE with widely used feature learning methods (Convolutional AE, PCA, ICA, LLE, Factor Analysis, and SVD), C-RAE showed the highest accuracy.},

The experimental evaluation confirms this and shows that the method created for the case study achieves state-of-the-art clustering quality and surpasses it in some cases.},

   abstract = {Pattern recognition generally requires that objects be described in terms of a set of measurable features. The selection and quality of the features representing each pattern have a considerable bearing on the success of subsequent pattern classification. Feature extraction is the process of deriving new features from the original features in order to reduce the cost of feature measurement, increase classifier efficiency, and allow higher classification accuracy. Many current feature extraction techniques involve linear transformations of the original pattern vectors to new vectors of lower dimensionality. While this is useful for data visualization and increasing classification efficiency, it does not necessarily reduce the number of features that must be measured since each new feature may be a linear combination of all of the features in the original pattern vector. Here, we present a new approach to feature extraction in which feature selection, feature extraction, and classifier training are performed simultaneously using a genetic algorithm. The genetic algorithm optimizes a vector of feature weights, which are used to scale the individual features in the original pattern vectors in either a linear or a nonlinear fashion. A masking vector is also employed to perform simultaneous selection of a subset of the features. We employ this technique in combination with the k nearest neighbor classification rule, and compare the results with classical feature selection and extraction techniques, including sequential floating forward feature selection, and linear discriminant analysis. We also present results for the identification of favorable water-binding sites on protein surfaces, an important problem in biochemistry and drug design.},

Little work has been done for dimensionality reduction of unsupervised data in which class information is not available. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is often used. However, PCA creates new features. It is difficult to obtain intuitive understanding of the data using the new features only. In this paper we are concerned with the problem of determining and choosing the important original features for unsupervised data. Our method is based on the observation that removing an irrelevant feature from the feature set may not change the underlying concept of the data, but not so otherwise. We propose an entropy measure for ranking features, and conduct extensive experiments to show that our method is able to find the important features. Also it compares well with a similar feature ranking method (Relief) that requires class information unlike our method.},

Moreover, we tested the effectiveness of batch normalization as a regularization method with different model settings. The experimental results demonstrate that ResNets mitigate the declining-accuracy effect and achieved promising classification performance with 10% and 5% training sample percentages for the University of Pavia and Indian Pines datasets, respectively.

In this paper, firstly, the network traffic was converted into grayscale images, and through transfer learning, the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) pre-trained model was used to extract the protocol features, so as to reduce the time and the amount of labeled data needed for the artificial neural network training.

Here, based on the powerful t-SNE technique applied to the local narrow emission-line galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 15, type-2 AGN and H ii galaxies can be clearly separated in the t-SNE determined two-dimensional projected map, and then the dividing lines can be mathematically determined in BPT diagrams, leading to charming harmonization of the theoretical expectations and the actual results from real observed properties. The results not only provide an interesting and robust method to determine the dividing lines in BPT diagrams through the powerful t-SNE technique, but also lead to further confirmation on previously defined composite galaxies more efficiently classified in the BPT diagram of [O iii ]/H Î² versus [N ii ]/H Î± . },

We describe a new technique for selecting quiescent galaxies based upon t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), an unsupervised machine learning algorithm for dimensionality reduction. This t-SNE selection provides an improvement both over UVJ, removing interlopers which otherwise would pass color selection, and over photometric template fitting, more strongly towards high redshift. Due to the similarity between the colors of high- and low-redshift quiescent galaxies, under our assumptions t-SNE outperforms template fitting in 63% of trials at redshifts where a large training sample already exists. It also may be able to select quiescent galaxies more efficiently at higher redshifts than the training sample.},

Not all of them are correctly processed by parameter estimation pipelines and we need to know about them. We present a semi-automated classification scheme which identifies different types of peculiar spectral morphologies, in an effort to discover and flag potentially problematic spectra and thus help to preserve the integrity of the survey's results. To this end we employ a recently developed dimensionality reduction technique t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding), which enables us to represent the complex spectral morphology in a two-dimensional projection map while still preserving the properties of the local neighbourhoods of spectra. We find that the majority (178,483) of the 209,533 Galah spectra considered in this study represents normal single stars, whereas 31,050 peculiar and problematic spectra with very diverse spectral features pertaining to 28,579 stars are distributed into 10 classification categories: Hot stars, Cool metal-poor giants, Molecular absorption bands, Binary stars, H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ emission, H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ emission superimposed on absorption, H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ P-Cygni, H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ inverted P-Cygni, Lithium absorption, and Problematic.

However, for a few percent of galaxies in every survey, these observations are insufficient and derived properties can be catastrophically wrong. Further, it is currently difficult or impossible to determine which objects have failed, so that these contaminate every study of galaxy properties. We develop a novel method to identify these objects by combining the astronomical codes that infer galaxy properties with the dimensionality reduction algorithm t-SNE, which groups similar objects to determine which inferred properties are out of place. This method provides an improvement for the COSMOS catalog, which already uses existing techniques for catastrophic error removal, and therefore should improve the quality of large catalogs and any studies that are sensitive to large redshift errors.},

   abstract = {In complex data with high dimensions, the dimension reduction methods are used to increase accuracy and speed in the classification algorithms. Feature clustering methods have had a good performance in the selection of important features of data due to using clustering methods. The process of selecting important features of data is a challenge in feature clustering methods which has led to the creation of different algorithms with different performances. The combination of the clustering methods and metaheuristic algorithms, especially the kind of population-based algorithms, have had good results in most cases. In this paper, a new feature clustering method is proposed which is used as a dimension reduction in the classification of brain tumors in 900 magnetic resonance images (MRI). The classification algorithm includes three main steps: in the first step, the Google-Net and ResNet-18 methods have been used for feature extraction of MRI images. Due to the creation of many features using the Google-Net and ResNet-18 methods, a new proposed feature clustering is introduced to reduce the feature dimensions in the second step. In designing the feature clustering algorithm, a new metaheuristic algorithm is introduced which is called the crocodiles hunting strategy optimization algorithm (CHS) that simulates crocodilesâ behavior in hunting. Also, the feature clustering algorithm introduced the new chromosome encoding for feature clustering which is called feature clustering based on the crocodiles hunting strategy optimization algorithm (FC-CHS). Finally, in the third step, the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm is used for classification. According to the results of classification on the MRI images, the proposed algorithm has achieved high accuracy in Google-Net and ResNet features based on confusion matrices. For comparing the performance of the FC-CHS, this algorithm is compared with five well-known dimension reduction algorithms. Also, real data are used to further investigate the performance of the FC-CHS algorithm. The results show that the combination of the FC-CHS and SVM algorithms have been reached high accuracy in Iris, and Wine data, and in other real data, the proposed algorithm is outperformed compared to other dimension reduction methods in most cases.},

Recent works on feature fusion technique have significantly boosted the generalization performances of food categorization tasks. However, the use of representation learning in the training process of feature fusion has rarely been explored. This study addresses the issue through a new supervised subnetwork-based feature encoding and pattern classification model, termed a wide hierarchical subnetwork-based neural network (Wi-HSNN). In particular, Wi-HSNN is a subnet-based iterative training process in which one pair of subnets is added to the framework in each iteration. Furthermore, instead of learning the optimal representations with the whole dataset, this paper introduces a batch-by-batch parallel scheme of Wi-HSNN to process large-scale datasets, such as Place365 set with more than 1.8 million samples. Extensive evaluations on eight benchmark datasets from food classification to scene image recognition demonstrated that the proposed solution has better representation learning capacity compared to existing encoding methods, and achieves stronger performance than existing approaches for food image classification tasks.},

While deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) are able to effectively amalgamate information, large numbers of parameters often make learned features inscrutable and difficult to transfer to alternative models. In order to better represent statistical texture information for remote-sensing image classification, in this letter, we investigate performing joint dimensionality reduction (DR) and classification using a novel histogram neural network. Motivated by a popular DR approach, t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), our proposed method incorporates a classification loss computed on samples in a low-dimensional embedding space. We compare the learned sample embeddings against coordinates found by t-SNE in terms of classification accuracy and qualitative assessment. We also explore the use of various divergence measures in the t-SNE objective. The proposed method has several advantages such as readily embedding out-of-sample points and reducing feature dimensionality while retaining class discriminability. Our results show that the proposed approach maintains and/or improves classification performance and reveals characteristics of features produced by neural networks that may be helpful for other applications.},

Not all the attributes in the datasets generated are important for training the machine learning algorithms. Some attributes might be irrelevant and some might not affect the outcome of the prediction. Ignoring or removing these irrelevant or less important attributes reduces the burden on machine learning algorithms.

The experimentation results prove that PCA outperforms LDA in all the measures. Also, the performance of the classifiers, Decision Tree, Random Forest examined is not affected much by using PCA and LDA.To further analyze the performance of PCA and LDA the eperimentation is carried out on Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) and Intrusion Detection System (IDS) datasets.

   abstract = {The pooling layer has achieved good results in reducing the feature dimension and parameters of convolution neural network (CNN), but it will cause different degrees of information loss. In order to retain as much feature information as possible, we design a pooling method based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA)-PCAPool. Firstly, all feature maps are traversed with the pooling window in which the data is extracted and stretched into row vectors. With the sliding of the pooling window, all row vectors are arranged in the matrix to form the sample matrix. Then all eigenvectors are extracted from the sample matrix by PCA algorithm to form the eigenvector matrix, which right multiplies the sample matrix to get the principal component matrix. Thirdly, each column of the principal component matrix is weighted with information coefficient which is determined by training to get the pooling vector. Finally, PCAPool result is obtained by blocks arrangement of pooling vector. PCAPool is tested with CNN-Quick, NIN, WRN-SAM, GP-CNN on datasets MNIST, CIFAR10/100 and SVHN. We also used AlexNet on Imagenet2012 to test PCAPool. The experiment results show that compared with traditional pooling methods, PCAPool could retain information in the pooling window better and improve the image classification accuracy.},

   abstract = {The world's corpora of data grow in size and complexity every day, making it increasingly difficult for experts to make sense out of their data. Although machine learning offers algorithms for finding patterns in data automatically, they often require algorithm-specific parameters, such as an appropriate distance function, which are outside the purview of a domain expert. We present a system that allows an expert to interact directly with a visual representation of the data to define an appropriate distance function, thus avoiding direct manipulation of obtuse model parameters. Adopting an iterative approach, our system first assumes a uniformly weighted Euclidean distance function and projects the data into a two-dimensional scatterplot view. The user can then move incorrectly-positioned data points to locations that reflect his or her understanding of the similarity of those data points relative to the other data points. Based on this input, the system performs an optimization to learn a new distance function and then re-projects the data to redraw the scatter-plot. We illustrate empirically that with only a few iterations of interaction and optimization, a user can achieve a scatterplot view and its corresponding distance function that reflect the user's knowledge of the data. In addition, we evaluate our system to assess scalability in data size and data dimension, and show that our system is computationally efficient and can provide an interactive or near-interactive user experience.

   abstract = {Dimensionality Reduction (DR) is a core building block in visualizing multidimensional data. For DR techniques to be useful in exploratory data analysis, they need to be adapted to human needs and domain-specific problems, ideally, interactively, and on-the-fly. Many visual analytics systems have already demonstrated the benefits of tightly integrating DR with interactive visualizations. Nevertheless, a general, structured understanding of this integration is missing. To address this, we systematically studied the visual analytics and visualization literature to investigate how analysts interact with automatic DR techniques. The results reveal seven common interaction scenarios that are amenable to interactive control such as specifying algorithmic constraints, selecting relevant features, or choosing among several DR algorithms. We investigate specific implementations of visual analysis systems integrating DR, and analyze ways that other machine learning methods have been combined with DR. Summarizing the results in a 'human in the loop' process model provides a general lens for the evaluation of visual interactive DR systems. We apply the proposed model to study and classify several systems previously described in the literature, and to derive future research opportunities.},

We propose a two-stage framework for visualizing such data based on dimension reduction methods. In the first stage, we obtain the reduced dimensional data by applying a supervised dimension reduction method such as linear discriminant analysis which preserves the original cluster structure in terms of its criteria. The resulting optimal reduced dimension depends on the optimization criteria and is often larger than 2. In the second stage, the dimension is further reduced to 2 for visualization purposes by another dimension reduction method such as principal component analysis. The role of the second-stage is to minimize the loss of information due to reducing the dimension all the way to 2. Using this framework, we propose several two-stage methods, and present their theoretical characteristics as well as experimental comparisons on both artificial and real-world text data sets.

We present an assistive visualization system which greatly reduces the load on the users and makes the process of model initialization and refinement more efficient, problem-driven, and engaging. Utilizing a sequence segmentation task with a Hidden Markov Model as an example, we assign each token in the sequence a feature vector based on its various properties within the sequence. These vectors are then clustered according to similarity, generating a layout of the individual tokens in form of a node link diagram where the length of the links is determined by the feature vector similarity. Users may then tune the weights of the feature vector components to improve the segmentation, which is visualized as a better separation of the clusters. Also, as individual clusters represent different classes, the user can now work at the cluster level to define token classes, instead of labelling one entry at time. Inconsistent entries visually identify themselves by locating at the periphery of clusters, and the user then helps refine the model by resolving these inconsistencies. Our system therefore makes efficient use of the knowledge of its users, only requesting user assistance for non-trivial data items. It so allows users to visually analyse data at a higher, more abstract level, improving scalability. Â©2010 IEEE.},

Our design philosophy is to support analysis of multivariate datasets through extensive interaction with the PCA output. To demonstrate the usefulness of our system, we performed a comparative user study with a known commercial system, SAS/INSIGHT's Interactive Data Exploration. Participants in our study solved a number of high-level analysis tasks with each interface and rated the systems on ease of learning and usefulness. Based on the participants' accuracy, speed, and qualitative feedback, we observe that our system helps users to better understand relationships between the data and the calculated eigenspace, which allows the participants to more accurately analyze the data.

   abstract = {Multidimensional projection-based visualization methods typically rely on clustering and attribute selection mechanisms to enable visual analysis of multidimensional data. Clustering is often employed to group similar instances according to their distance in the visual space. However, considering only distances in the visual space may be misleading due to projection errors as well as the lack of guarantees to ensure that distinct clusters contain instances with different content. Identifying clusters made up of a few elements is also an issue for most clustering methods. In this work we propose a novel multidimensional projection-based visualization technique that relies on representative instances to define clusters in the visual space. Representative instances are selected by a deterministic sampling scheme derived from matrix decomposition, which is sensitive to the variability of data while still been able to handle classes with a small number of instances. Moreover, the sampling mechanism can easily be adapted to select relevant attributes from each cluster. Therefore, our methodology unifies sampling, clustering, and feature selection in a simple framework. A comprehensive set of experiments validate our methodology, showing it outperforms most existing sampling and feature selection techniques.

   abstract = {Methods of dimensionality reduction provide a way to understand and visualize the structure of complex data sets. Traditional methods like principal component analysis and classical metric multidimensional scaling suffer from being based on linear models. Until recently, very few methods were able to reduce the data dimensionality in a nonlinear way. However, since the late nineties, many new methods have been developed and nonlinear dimensionality reduction, also called manifold learning, has become a hot topic. New advances that account for this rapid growth are, e.g. the use of graphs to represent the manifold topology, and the use of new metrics like the geodesic distance. In addition, new optimization schemes, based on kernel techniques and spectral decomposition, have lead to spectral embedding, which encompasses many of the recently developed methods. This book describes existing and advanced methods to reduce the dimensionality of numerical databases. For each method, the description starts from intuitive ideas, develops the necessary mathematical details, and ends by outlining the algorithmic implementation. Methods are compared with each other with the help of different illustrative examples. The purpose of the book is to summarize clear facts and ideas about well-known methods as well as recent developments in the topic of nonlinear dimensionality reduction. With this goal in mind, methods are all described from a unifying point of view, in order to highlight their respective strengths and shortcomings. The book is primarily intended for statisticians, computer scientists and data analysts. It is also accessible to other practitioners having a basic background in statistics and/or computational learning, like psychologists (in psychometry) and economists. John A.

   abstract = {Dimension reduction techniques are essential for feature selection and feature extraction of complex high-dimensional data. These techniques, which construct low-dimensional representations of data, are typically geometrically motivated, computationally efficient and approximately preserve certain structural properties of the data. However, they are often used as black box solutions in data exploration and their results can be difficult to interpret. To assess the quality of these results, quality measures, such as co-ranking [LV09], have been proposed to quantify structural distortions that occur between high-dimensional and low-dimensional data representations. Such measures could be evaluated and visualized point-wise to further highlight erroneous regions [MLGH13]. In this work, we provide an interactive visualization framework for exploring high-dimensional data via its two-dimensional embeddings obtained from dimension reduction, using a rich set of user interactions. We ask the following question: what new insights do we obtain regarding the structure of the data, with interactive manipulations of its embeddings in the visual space? We augment the two-dimensional embeddings with structural abstractions obtained from hierarchical clusterings, to help users navigate and manipulate subsets of the data. We use point-wise distortion measures to highlight interesting regions in the domain, and further to guide our selection of the appropriate level of clusterings that are aligned with the regions of interest. Under the static setting, point-wise distortions indicate the level of structural uncertainty within the embeddings. Under the dynamic setting, on-the-fly updates of point-wise distortions due to data movement and data deletion reflect structural relations among different parts of the data, which may lead to new and valuable insights.

In order to be able to optimize the process, identify problems, or common problem solving strategies, recording and reproducibility of this process is needed. This is facilitated by tracking of user actions categorized according to a taxonomy of interactions. Visual Analytics includes several means of interaction that are differentiated according to three fields: Information visualization, reasoning, and data processing. At present, however, only separate taxonomies for interaction techniques exist in these three fields. Each taxonomy covers only a part of the actions undertaken in Visual Analytics. Moreover, as they use different foundations (user intentions vs. User actions) and employ different terminology, it is not clear to what extent they overlap and cover the whole Visual Analytics interaction space.

State-of-art methods rely on solid mathematical and computational foundations that enable sophisticated and flexible interactive tools. Current methods are even capable of modifying data attributes during interaction, highlighting regions of potential interest in the feature space, and building visualizations that bring out the relevance of attributes. However, those methodologies rely on complex and non-intuitive interfaces that hamper the free handling of the feature spaces. Moreover, visualizing how neighborhood structures are affected during the space manipulation is also an issue for existing methods. This paper presents a novel visualization-assisted methodology for interacting and transforming data attributes embedded in feature spaces. The proposed approach relies on a combination of multidimensional projections and local transformations to provide an interactive mechanism for modifying attributes. Besides enabling a simple and intuitive visual layout, our approach allows the user to easily observe the changes in neighborhood structures during interaction.

   abstract = {Many modern applications of analytical chemistry involve the collection of large megavariate data sets and subsequent processing with multivariate analysis techniques (MVA), two of the more common goals being data analysis (also known as data mining and exploratory data analysis) and classification. Classification attempts to determine variables that can distinguish known classes allowing unknown samples to be correctly assigned, whereas data analysis seeks to uncover and understand or confirm relationships between the samples and the variables. An important part of analysis is visualization which allows analysts to apply their expertise and knowledge and is often easier for the samples than the variables since there are frequently far more of the latter. Here we describe principal component variable grouping (PCVG), an unsupervised, intuitive method that assigns a large number of variables to a smaller number of groups that can be more readily visualized and understood. Knowledge of the source or nature of the variables in a group allows them all to be appropriately treated, for example, removed if they result from uninteresting effects or replaced by a single representative for further processing.

   abstract = {Big databases are increasingly widespread and are therefore hard to understand, in exploratory biomedicine science, big data in health research is highly exciting because data-based analyses can travel quicker than hypothesis-based research. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a method to reduce the dimensionality of certain datasets. Improves interpretability but without losing much information. It achieves this by creating new covariates that are not related to each other. Finding those new variables, or what we call the main components, will reduce the eigenvalue /eigenvectors solution problem. (PCA) can be said to be an adaptive data analysis technology because technology variables are developed to adapt to different data types and structures. This review will start by introducing the basic ideas of (PCA), describe some concepts related to (PCA), and discussing. What it can do, and reviewed fifteen articles of (PCA) that have been introduced and published in the last three years.},

Widely used techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) aim to identify dominant trends in one dataset. However, in many settings we have datasets collected under different conditions, e.g., a treatment and a control experiment, and we are interested in visualizing and exploring patterns that are specific to one dataset. This paper proposes a method, contrastive principal component analysis (cPCA), which identifies low-dimensional structures that are enriched in a dataset relative to comparison data. In a wide variety of experiments, we demonstrate that cPCA with a background dataset enables us to visualize dataset-specific patterns missed by PCA and other standard methods. We further provide a geometric interpretation of cPCA and strong mathematical guarantees.

In spite of myriad advances, recovering interpretable biological signal from data corrupted by technical noise remains a prevalent open problem. Several classes of procedures, among them classical dimensionality reduction techniques and others incorporating subject-matter knowledge, have provided effective advances. However, no procedure currently satisfies the dual objectives of recovering stable and relevant features simultaneously. Results: Inspired by recent proposals for making use of control data in the removal of unwanted variation, we propose a variant of principal component analysis (PCA), sparse contrastive PCA that extracts sparse, stable, interpretable and relevant biological signal. The new methodology is compared to competing dimensionality reduction approaches through a simulation study and via analyses of several publicly available protein expression, microarray gene expression and single-cell transcriptome sequencing datasets.

With the ever increasing amounts and complexity of data, the demand for systems to help with these comparisons is also growing. Increasingly, information visualization tools support such comparisons explicitly, beyond simply allowing a viewer to examine each object individually. In this paper, we argue that the design of information visualizations of complex objects can, and should, be studied in general, that is independently of what those objects are. As a first step in developing this general understanding of comparison, we propose a general taxonomy of visual designs for comparison that groups designs into three basic categories, which can be combined. To clarify the taxonomy and validate its completeness, we provide a survey of work in information visualization related to comparison. Although we find a great diversity of systems and approaches, we see that all designs are assembled from the building blocks of juxtaposition, superposition and explicit encodings. This initial exploration shows the power of our model, and suggests future challenges in developing a general understanding of comparative visualization and facilitating the development of more comparative visualization tools.

To explore and explain such relations, we propose a set of interactive visualization techniques. First, we adapt and enhance biplots to show the data variables in the projected threedimensional space. Next, we use a set of interactive bar chart legends to show variables that are visible from a given viewpoint and also assist users to select an optimal viewpoint to examine a desired set of variables. Finally, we propose an interactive viewpoint legend that provides an overview of the information visible in a given three-dimensional projection from all possible viewpoints.

However, to interpret the DR result for gaining useful insights from the data, it would take additional analysis effort such as identifying clusters and understanding their characteristics. While there are many automatic methods (e.g., density-based clustering methods) to identify clusters, effective methods for understanding a cluster's characteristics are still lacking. A cluster can be mostly characterized by its distribution of feature values. Reviewing the original feature values is not a straightforward task when the number of features is large. To address this challenge, we present a visual analytics method that effectively highlights the essential features of a cluster in a DR result. To extract the essential features, we introduce an enhanced usage of contrastive principal component analysis (cPCA). Our method, called ccPCA (contrasting clusters in PCA), can calculate each feature's relative contribution to the contrast between one cluster and other clusters. With ccPCA, we have created an interactive system including a scalable visualization of clusters' feature contributions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and system with case studies using several publicly available datasets.},

We first show empirical observation that common samples are close to each other

different generative models produce rare images can be effectively compared. We
also propose a method to compare rarities between datasets that share the same

Control charts pattern recognition (CCPR) is the most investigated technique.

In this work, piezoelectric strain sensors are used to measure the strain on press column surface which is the response of the press to the stamping force. A feature extraction approach based on the wavelet transform and the energy distribution of the reconstructed wavelet coefficients is proposed. The energy distribution is used as the process feature for similarity distance calculation for the process clustering. Semi-supervised clustering is applied to the process monitoring considering that many normal data sets are available while the failure data is difficult to obtain in practice.

   abstract = {This paper proposes an information theoretic criterion for comparing two partitions, or clusterings, of the same data set. The criterion, called variation of information (VI), measures the amount of information lost and gained in changing from clustering C to clustering Câ². The basic properties of VI are presented and discussed. We focus on two kinds of properties: (1) those that help one build intuition about the new criterion (in particular, it is shown the VI is a true metric on the space of clusterings), and (2) those that pertain to the comparability of VI values over different experimental conditions. As the latter properties have rarely been discussed explicitly before, other existing comparison criteria are also examined in their light. Finally we present the VI from an axiomatic point of view, showing that it is the only "sensible" criterion for comparing partitions that is both aligned to the lattice and convexely additive. As a consequence, we prove an impossibility result for comparing partitions: there is no criterion for comparing partitions that simultaneously satisfies the above two desirable properties and is bounded.

   abstract = {The true cluster number of the dataset in practical applications is rarely known in advance. Therefore, it is necessary to use a cluster validity index to evaluate the clustering results and determine the optimal cluster number. However, the performance of existing cluster validity indices is vulnerable to various factors such as cluster shape and density. To solve the above issues, this paper proposes a new cluster validity index based on augmented non-shared nearest neighbors (ANCV). The ANCV index is based on the following principles: (1) Within-cluster compactness can be measured by the distance between the pairs of data points with fewer shared nearest neighbors. (2) The distances between the pairs of data points at the intersection of clusters can be used to estimate the between-cluster separation. On this basis, the above point pairs are further extended to their augmented non-shared nearest neighbors, thereby forming small clusters. Then, the average distance within and between these clusters is calculated respectively to estimate the within-cluster compactness and between-cluster separation. Finally, the optimal number of clusters is determined by the difference between the between-cluster separation and the within-cluster compactness. Experimental results on both 12 two-dimensional synthetic datasets and 10 real datasets from UCI have shown that the ANCV index performs the best among all compared indices.},

   abstract = {Finding compact and well-separated clusters in data sets is a challenging task. Most clustering algorithms try to minimize certain clustering objective functions. These functions usually reflect the intra-cluster similarity and inter-cluster dissimilarity. However, the use of such functions alone may not lead to the finding of well-separated and, in some cases, compact clusters. Therefore additional measures, called cluster validity indices, are used to estimate the true number of well-separated and compact clusters. Some of these indices are well-suited to be included into the optimization model of the clustering problem. Silhouette coefficients are among such indices. In this paper, a new optimization model of the clustering problem is developed where the clustering function is used as an objective and silhouette coefficients are used to formulate constraints. Then an algorithm, called CLUSCO (CLustering Using Silhouette COefficients), is designed to construct clusters incrementally. Three schemes are discussed to reduce the computational complexity of the algorithm. Its performance is evaluated using fourteen real-world data sets and compared with that of three state-of-the-art clustering algorithms. Results show that the CLUSCO is able to compute compact clusters which are significantly better separable in comparison with those obtained by other algorithms.},

   abstract = {Anomaly Detection (AD) in images is a fundamental computer vision problem and refers to identifying images and/or image substructures that deviate significantly from the norm. Popular AD algorithms commonly try to learn a model of normality from scratch using task specific datasets, but are limited to semi-supervised approaches employing mostly normal data due to the inaccessibility of anomalies on a large scale combined with the ambiguous nature of anomaly appearance. We follow an alternative approach and demonstrate that deep feature representations learned by discriminative models on large natural image datasets are well suited to describe normality and detect even subtle anomalies in a transfer learning setting. Our model of normality is established by fitting a multivariate Gaussian (MVG) to deep feature representations of classification networks trained on ImageNet using normal data only. By subsequently applying the Mahalanobis distance as the anomaly score we outperform the current state of the art on the public MVTec AD dataset, achieving an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve of 95.8 Â± 1.2% (mean Â± SEM) over all 15 classes. We further investigate why the learned representations are discriminative to the AD task using Principal Component Analysis. We find that the principal components containing little variance in normal data are the ones crucial for discriminating between normal and anomalous instances. This gives a possible explanation to the often sub-par performance of AD approaches trained from scratch using normal data only. By selectively fitting a MVG to these most relevant components only, we are able to further reduce model complexity while retaining AD performance. We also investigate setting the working point by selecting acceptable False Positive Rate thresholds based on the MVG assumption.

The performance of a deep network is known to be improved as the number of feature maps increases. However, it is difficult to improve the performance by simply raising the number of feature maps. In this paper, we propose and analyze how to use feature maps effectively to improve the performance of the conventional SSD. The enhanced performance was obtained by changing the structure close to the classifier network, rather than growing layers close to the input data, e.g., by replacing VGGNet with ResNet. The proposed network is suitable for sharing the weights in the classifier networks, by which property, the training can be faster with better generalization power. For the Pascal VOC 2007 test set trained with VOC 2007 and VOC 2012 training sets, the proposed network with the input size of 300 Ã 300 achieved 78.5% mAP (mean average precision) at the speed of 35.0 FPS (frame per second), while the network with a 512 Ã 512 sized input achieved 80.8% mAP at 16.6 FPS using Nvidia Titan X GPU.

On the challenging, widely used MVTec AD benchmark PatchCore achieves an image-level anomaly detection AUROC score of up to 99.6%, more than halving the error compared to the next best competitor.

In recent years, the anomaly detection community has attempted to obtain better features using advances in deep self-supervised feature learning. Surprisingly, a very promising direction, using pre-trained deep features, has been mostly overlooked. In this paper, we first empirically establish the perhaps expected, but unreported result, that combining pre-trained features with simple anomaly detection and segmentation methods convincingly outperforms, much more complex, state-of-the-art methods. In order to obtain further performance gains in anomaly detection, we adapt pre-trained features to the target distribution. Although transfer learning methods are well established in multi-class classification problems, the one-class classification (OCC) setting is not as well explored. It turns out that naive adaptation methods, which typically work well in supervised learning, often result in catastrophic collapse (feature deterioration) and reduce performance in OCC settings. A popular OCC method, DeepSVDD, advocates using specialized architectures, but this limits the adaptation performance gain. We propose two methods for combating collapse: i) a variant of early stopping that dynamically learns the stopping iteration ii) elastic regularization inspired by continual learning. Our method, PANDA, outperforms the state-of-the-art in the OCC, outlier exposure and anomaly segmentation settings by large margins.},

   abstract = {Deep learning techniques, especially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), dominate the benchmarks for most computer vision tasks. These state-of-the-art results are typically obtained through supervised learning, for which large annotated datasets are required. However, acquiring such datasets for manufacturing applications remains a challenging proposition due to the time and costs involved in their collection. To overcome this disadvantage, a novel framework is proposed for data augmentation by creating synthetic images using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The generator synthesizes new surface defect images from random noise which is trained over time to get realistic fakes. These synthetic images can be used further for training of classification algorithms. Three GAN architectures are trained, and the entire data augmentation pipeline is implemented for the Northeastern University (China) Classification (NEU-CLS) dataset for hot-rolled steel strips from NEU Surface Defect Database. The classification accuracy of a simple CNN architecture is measured on synthetic augmented data and further it is compared with similar state-of-the-arts. It is observed that the proposed GANs-based augmentation scheme significantly improves the performance of CNN for classification of surface defects. The classically augmented CNN yields sensitivity and specificity of 90.28% and 98.06% respectively. In contrast, the synthetically augmented CNN yields better results, with sensitivity and specificity of 95.33% and 99.16% respectively. Also, the use of GANs is demonstrated to disentangle the representation space and to add additional domain knowledge through synthetic augmentation that can be difficult to replicate through classic augmentation. The proposed framework demonstrates high generalization capability. It may be applied to other supervised surface inspection tasks, and thus facilitate the development of advanced vision-based inspection instruments for manufacturing applications.},

Moreover, we integrate the multi-scale feature matching strategy into the framework, and this hierarchical feature matching enables the student network to receive a mixture of multi-level knowledge from the feature pyramid under better supervision, thus allowing to detect anomalies of various sizes. The difference between feature pyramids generated by the two networks serves as a scoring function indicating the probability of anomaly occurring.

We applied a data augmentation technique to overcome the class-imbalance issue. The proposed model uses convolution layers to extract valuable features instead of manual feature extraction. Moreover, state-of-the-art regularization methods such as batch normalization and spatial dropout are used to improve the classification performance of the CNN-WDI model. The experimental results comparison using a real wafer dataset shows that our model outperformed all previously proposed machine learning-based wafer defect classification models. The average classification accuracy of the CNN-WDI model with nine different wafer map defects is 96.2%, which is an increment of 6.4% from the last highest average accuracy using the same dataset.},

   abstract = {This article introduces a technique known as clustering with particle for object detection (CPOD) for use in smart factories. CPOD builds on regional-based methods to identify smart object data using outlier detection, clustering, particle swarm optimization (PSO), and deep convolutional networks. The process starts by removing noise and errors from the images database by the local outlier factor (LOF) algorithm. Next, the algorithm studies different correlations from the set of images in the database. This creates homogeneous, and similar clusters using the well-known k-means algorithm, and the FastRCNN (fast region convolutional neural network) uses these clusters to design efficient and more focused models. PSO is used to optimize the different parameters including, the number of neighbors of LOF, the number of clusters of k-means, the number of epochs, and the error learning rate for FastRCNN. The inference process benefits from the knowledge provided by training. Instead of considering a complex single model of the whole images database, we consider a simple homogeneous model. To demonstrate the usefulness of our approach, intensive experiments have been carried out on standard images database, and real smart manufacturer data. Our results show that CPOD when compared to baseline object detection solutions is superior in terms of runtime and accuracy.},

   abstract = {In recent years, the effect of the curse of high dimensionality has been studied in great detail on several problems such as clustering, nearest neighbor search, and indexing. In high dimensional space the data becomes sparse, and traditional indexing and algorithmic techniques fail from a efficiency and/or effectiveness perspective. Recent research results show that in high dimensional space, the concept of proximity, distance or nearest neighbor may not even be qualitatively meaningful. In this paper, we view the dimensionality curse from the point of view of the distance metrics which are used to measure the similarity between objects. We specifically examine the behavior of the commonly used Lknorm and show that the problem of meaningfulness in high dimensionality is sensitive to the value of k. For example, this means that the Manhattan distance metric (L1 norm) is consistently more preferable than the Euclidean distance metric (L2 norm) for high dimensional data mining applications. Using the intuition derived from our analysis, we introduce and examine a natural extension of the Lknorm to fractional distance metrics. We show that the fractional distance metric provides more meaningful results both from the theoretical and empirical perspective. The results show that fractional distance metrics can significantly improve the effectiveness of standard clustering algorithms such as the k-means algorithm.},

across all industries, such as disease diagnosis in healthcare or quality
assurance in manufacturing. Manual inspection of images, when extended over a
monotonously repetitive period of time is very time consuming and can lead to
anomalies being overlooked.Artificial neural networks have proven themselves
very successful on simple, repetitive tasks, in some cases even outperforming
humans. Therefore, in this paper we investigate different methods of deep
learning, including supervised and unsupervised learning, for anomaly detection
applied to a quality assurance use case. We utilize the MVTec anomaly dataset
and develop three different models, a CNN for supervised anomaly detection,
KD-CAE for autoencoder anomaly detection, NI-CAE for noise induced anomaly
detection and a DCGAN for generating reconstructed images. By experiments, we
found that KD-CAE performs better on the anomaly datasets compared to CNN and
NI-CAE, with NI-CAE performing the best on the Transistor dataset. We also
implemented a DCGAN for the creation of new training data but due to
computational limitation and lack of extrapolating the mechanics of AnoGAN, we
restricted ourselves just to the generation of GAN based images. We conclude
that unsupervised methods are more powerful for anomaly detection in images,
especially in a setting where only a small amount of anomalous data is
available, or the data is unlabeled.},

   abstract = {Humans can easily detect a defect (anomaly) because it is different or
salient when compared to the surface it resides on. Today, manual human visual
inspection is still the norm because it is difficult to automate anomaly
detection. Neural networks are a useful tool that can teach a machine to find
defects. However, they require a lot of training examples to learn what a
defect is and it is tedious and expensive to get these samples. We tackle the
problem of teaching a network with a low number of training samples with a
system we call AnoNet. AnoNet's architecture is similar to CompactCNN with the
exceptions that (1) it is a fully convolutional network and does not use
strided convolution; (2) it is shallow and compact which minimizes over-fitting
by design; (3) the compact design constrains the size of intermediate features
which allows training to be done without image downsizing; (4) the model
footprint is low making it suitable for edge computation; and (5) the anomaly
can be detected and localized despite the weak labelling. AnoNet learns to
detect the underlying shape of the anomalies despite the weak annotation as
well as preserves the spatial localization of the anomaly. Pre-seeding AnoNet
with an engineered filter bank initialization technique reduces the total
samples required for training and also achieves state-of-the-art performance.
Compared to the CompactCNN, AnoNet achieved a massive 94% reduction of network
parameters from 1.13 million to 64 thousand parameters. Experiments were
conducted on four data-sets and results were compared against CompactCNN and
DeepLabv3. AnoNet improved the performance on an average across all data-sets
by 106% to an F1 score of 0.98 and by 13% to an AUROC value of 0.942. AnoNet
can learn from a limited number of images. For one of the data-sets, AnoNet
learnt to detect anomalies after a single pass through just 53 training images.},

Train images based on convolutional neural networks and the Vision Transformer.
Different from previous AD works, in which anomalies are identified with a

the proposed method detects abnormal difference between two images taken at
different times of the same region. In other words, we cast anomaly detection
problem with a single image into a difference detection problem with two
images. The core idea of the proposed method is that the 'anomaly' usually
represents an abnormal state instead of a specific object, and this state
should be identified by a pair of images. In addition, we introduced a deep
feature difference AD network (AnoDFDNet) which sufficiently explored the
potential of the Vision Transformer and convolutional neural networks. To
verify the effectiveness of the proposed AnoDFDNet, we collected three
datasets, a difference dataset (Diff Dataset), a foreign body dataset (FB

We used a template matching algorithm to automate the cropping around the optic nerve head at three different scales and extracted the features using pretrained networks from both cropped and full versions of the images. Cropped features were concatenated with full image features to create expanded feature sets. Next, we conducted extensive ten-fold cross-validation experiments using random forest and optimised logistic regression base classifiers to estimate the accuracy of models trained on each feature set individually and also on various combinations of feature sets from the full and cropped images. The best feature extractor for glaucoma detection was the residual network (ResNet) giving 0.97 cross validated AUC-ROC in conjunction with the random forest classifier using concatenated features. The experimental results indicate that ResNet architecture is best suited as a feature extractor for glaucoma identification from retinal fundus images, but only if two feature sets (full and cropped) are utilised.},

phenomenon in common: on the first layer they learn features similar to Gabor
filters and color blobs. Such first-layer features appear not to be specific to
a particular dataset or task, but general in that they are applicable to many
datasets and tasks. Features must eventually transition from general to
specific by the last layer of the network, but this transition has not been
studied extensively. In this paper we experimentally quantify the generality
versus specificity of neurons in each layer of a deep convolutional neural
network and report a few surprising results. Transferability is negatively
affected by two distinct issues: (1) the specialization of higher layer neurons
to their original task at the expense of performance on the target task, which
was expected, and (2) optimization difficulties related to splitting networks
between co-adapted neurons, which was not expected. In an example network
trained on ImageNet, we demonstrate that either of these two issues may
dominate, depending on whether features are transferred from the bottom,
middle, or top of the network. We also document that the transferability of
features decreases as the distance between the base task and target task
increases, but that transferring features even from distant tasks can be better
than using random features. A final surprising result is that initializing a
network with transferred features from almost any number of layers can produce
a boost to generalization that lingers even after fine-tuning to the target

   abstract = {We present a new clustering method in the form of a single clustering equation that is able to directly discover groupings in the data. The main proposition is that the first neighbor of each sample is all one needs to discover large chains and finding the groups in the data. In contrast to most existing clustering algorithms our method does not require any hyper-parameters, distance thresholds and/or the need to specify the number of clusters. The proposed algorithm belongs to the family of hierarchical agglomerative methods. The technique has a very low computational overhead, is easily scalable and applicable to large practical problems. Evaluation on well known datasets from different domains ranging between 1077 and 8.1 million samples shows substantial performance gains when compared to the existing clustering techniques.},

   abstract = {The increasing digitization of medical imaging enables machine learning based improvements in detecting, visualizing and segmenting lesions, easing the workload for medical experts. However, supervised machine learning requires reliable labelled data, which is is often difficult or impossible to collect or at least time consuming and thereby costly. Therefore methods requiring only partly labeled data (semi-supervised) or no labeling at all (unsupervised methods) have been applied more regularly. Anomaly detection is one possible methodology that is able to leverage semi-supervised and unsupervised methods to handle medical imaging tasks like classification and segmentation. This paper uses a semi-exhaustive literature review of relevant anomaly detection papers in medical imaging to cluster into applications, highlight important results, establish lessons learned and give further advice on how to approach anomaly detection in medical imaging. The qualitative analysis is based on google scholar and 4 different search terms, resulting in 120 different analysed papers. The main results showed that the current research is mostly motivated by reducing the need for labelled data. Also, the successful and substantial amount of research in the brain MRI domain shows the potential for applications in further domains like OCT and chest X-ray.},

   abstract = {Distance measures play an important role in cluster analysis. There is no single distance measure that best fits for all types of the clustering problems. So, it is important to find set of distance measures for different clustering techniques on datasets that yields optimal results. In this paper, an attempt has been made to evaluate ten different distance measures on eight clustering techniques. The quality of the distance measures has been computed on basis of three factors: accuracy, inter-cluster and intra-cluster distances. The performance of clustering algorithms on different distance measures has been evaluated on three artificial and six real life datasets. The experimental results reveal that the performance and quality of different distance measures vary with the nature of data as well as clustering techniques. Hence choice of distance measure must be done on basis of dataset and clustering technique.},

   abstract = {With the rapid development of science and technology, high-dimensional data have been widely used in various fields. Due to the complex characteristics of high-dimensional data, it is usually distributed in the union of several low-dimensional subspaces. In the past several decades, subspace clustering (SC) methods have been widely studied as they can restore the underlying subspace of high-dimensional data and perform fast clustering with the help of the data self-expressiveness property. The SC methods aim to construct an affinity matrix by the self-representation coefficient of high-dimensional data and then obtain the clustering results using the spectral clustering method. The key is how to design a self-expressiveness model that can reveal the real subspace structure of data. In this survey, we focus on the development of SC methods in the past two decades and present a new classification criterion to divide them into three categories based on the purpose of clustering, i.e., low-rank sparse SC, local structure preserving SC, and kernel SC. We further divide them into subcategories according to the strategy of constructing the representation coefficient. In addition, the applications of SC methods in face recognition, motion segmentation, handwritten digits recognition, and speech emotion recognition are introduced. Finally, we have discussed several interesting and meaningful future research directions.},

   abstract = {Feature selection is one of the most important preprocessing steps in Machine Learning. This can be broadly divided into search based methods and ranking based methods. The ranking based methods are very popular because they need much lesser computational power. There can be many different ways to rank the features. One of the ways to measure effectiveness of a feature is by evaluating its ability to separate the classes involved. These interclass Separability based measures can be directly used as a feature ranking tool for binary classification problems. Bhattacharya Distance which is the most popular among them has been used majorly in a recursive setup to select good quality feature subsets. Jeffries-Matusita (JM) distance improves Bhattacharya distance by normalizing it between 0 and 2. In this paper, we have ranked the features based on JM distance. The results are comparable with mutual information, Relief and Chi Squared based measures as per experiments conducted over 24 public datasets but in much lesser time. JM distance also provide some intuition about the dataset prior to any feature selection or machine learning algorithm. A comparison has been done on classification accuracy and JM scores of these datasets, which can provide a good intuition on how good a dataset is for classification and point out the need of or lack of further feature collection.},

   abstract = {Clustering evaluation plays an important role in unsupervised learning systems, as it is often necessary to automatically quantify the quality of generated cluster configurations. This is especially useful for comparing the performance of different clustering algorithms as well as determining the optimal number of clusters in clustering algorithms that do not estimate it internally. Many clustering quality indexes have been proposed over the years and different indexes are used in different contexts. There is no unifying protocol for clustering evaluation, so it is often unclear which quality index to use in which case. In this chapter, we review the existing clustering quality measures and evaluate them in the challenging context of high-dimensional data clustering. High-dimensional data is sparse and distances tend to concentrate, possibly affecting the applicability of various clustering quality indexes. We analyze the stability and discriminative power of a set of standard clustering quality measures with increasing data dimensionality. Our evaluation shows that the curse of dimensionality affects different clustering quality indexes in different ways and that some are to be preferred when determining clustering quality in many dimensions.},
